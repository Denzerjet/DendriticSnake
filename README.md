# NeuroticSnake

The original upload failed

neurotic snake exists on an old computer

do not currently have access to it, will upload when I do

or might re-write it lol

sum:

it was an 11 input bool layer of (foodx, foody, snake_headx, snake_heady, obstacle_north, obstacle_west, obstacle_east, obstacle_south, grid_height, grid_width, something_else)

it was reinforcement learning so -1 score when it died, +0.1 when it got a food
